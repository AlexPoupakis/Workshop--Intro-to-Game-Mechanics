# Workshop: Intro to Game Mechanics
A repository for my 2-hour long "Intro to Game Mechanics" Workshop in the Startup Greece Week 2020 event. The goal was to get familiar with basic (2D) game concepts and implement (part of) a 2D browser game.

## Overview
* Game loops
* Affine Matrix Transformations
* Animation sequencing
* Collision Detection
* Parallax scrolling

## Case study
For this workshop, [StormWinds The Lost Campaigns](https://armorgames.com/play/3099/stormwinds-the-lost-campaigns) was used as an example and a general direction. The implementation includes the first two types of enemies and the Machine Gun.
The official game displays only a static background image, but for the purposes of this workshop, we deviated to a more interesting - and completely out of theme - parallax-effect background.
