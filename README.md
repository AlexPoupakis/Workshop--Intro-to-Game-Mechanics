# Workshop: Intro to Game Mechanics
A repository for my 2-hour long "Intro to Game Mechanics" Workshop in the Startup Greece Week 2020 event. The goal was to get familiar with basic (2D) game concepts and implement (part of) a 2D browser game.

## Overview
* Game loops
* Affine Matrix Transformations
* Animation sequencing
* Collision Detection
* Parallax scrolling

## Case study
For this workshop, [StormWinds The Lost Campaigns](https://armorgames.com/play/3099/stormwinds-the-lost-campaigns) was used as an example and a general direction. The implementation includes the first two types of enemies and the Machine Gun.
The official game displays only a static background image, but for the purposes of this workshop, we deviated to a more interesting - and completely out of theme - parallax-effect background.

## Game resources
In order to implement our own mini-game, we naturally need certain... artistic resources. Namely, the sprites and background images. The former where graciously extracted from the browser game itself, by means of sophisticated, state-of-the-art methods and tools (print screen, Paint, and a [suite of online png tools](https://onlinepngtools.com/)). The later were amongst the free-to-use collection at [itch.io](itch.io).
